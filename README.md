# Bork

![Code Quality](https://img.shields.io/badge/pylint-8.93%2F10-brightgreen.svg)

Bork is a simple database application for photo messaging in a social context, like Instagram but based on chat groups. This repository holds the server-side implementation of the app. The data in the application is managed by a relational database system and exposed to client applications through a REST API. Moreover, the implementation conforms to a Model-View-Controller design pattern.
